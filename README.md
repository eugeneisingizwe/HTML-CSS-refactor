# HTML-CSS-Refactor ReadME

## Description


- The motivation behind this project stemed from wanting to implement and to apply the HTML and the CSS concepts learned during class. 
- This project was build to demonstrate understanding of the concept learned in class by refactoring an existing HTML and CSS code and to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. 
- By refoctoring the existing Code, I was able to improve the internal code by making small changes without altering the code's external behavior. 
- I learned how to refactor an existing code by adding semantic HTML elements that follows a logical structure indepedent of styling and positioning.
